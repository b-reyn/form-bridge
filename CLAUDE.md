# CLAUDE.md - Persistent Context for Form-Bridge Project

## Project Overview
**Multi-Tenant Serverless Form Ingestion & Fan-Out System**
- Architecture: EventBridge-Centric (Option A) 
- Stack: AWS Lambda, EventBridge, DynamoDB, Step Functions, API Gateway
- Purpose: Ingest form submissions from multiple sources, persist per-tenant, and fan-out to destinations

## Agent Knowledge Management Protocol

### ðŸ§  MANDATORY: Strategy Management for All Agents

**EVERY agent MUST follow this protocol:**

1. **START OF TASK**: 
   - Read your strategy document at `/docs/strategies/{agent-name}-strategy.md`
   - Research latest best practices for your domain
   - Review past decisions and learnings

2. **DURING TASK**:
   - Document important decisions
   - Note challenges and solutions
   - Track patterns and anti-patterns discovered

3. **END OF TASK**:
   - Update your strategy document with new learnings
   - Record successful patterns for future use
   - Document any issues for next time

### Strategy Document Structure
Each agent maintains their strategy document with:
- **Current Best Practices**: Latest industry standards (with dates)
- **Project-Specific Patterns**: What works for this codebase
- **Decision Log**: Important choices and rationale
- **Knowledge Base**: Accumulated wisdom and gotchas
- **Todo/Backlog**: Future improvements to consider

## Project Commands

### Infrastructure
```bash
# CDK/SAM commands
sam build
sam deploy --guided
sam local start-api

# Testing
pytest tests/
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

# Linting
pylint lambdas/
npm run lint
```

### Development Workflow
1. Check relevant strategy documents
2. Research current best practices
3. Implement with test-first approach
4. Update strategy documents
5. Create comprehensive documentation

## Agent Collaboration Protocol

### Engineering Agents
- **principal-engineer**: Technical lead, coordinates all specialists
- **eventbridge-architect**: Event bus and routing expert
- **lambda-serverless-expert**: Lambda functions and serverless patterns
- **dynamodb-architect**: NoSQL data modeling
- **step-functions-orchestrator**: Workflow orchestration
- **api-gateway-specialist**: API design and implementation
- **monitoring-observability-expert**: CloudWatch, X-Ray, metrics

### Product Agents
- **product-owner**: Requirements and priorities
- **project-manager**: Scheduling and coordination
- **ux-researcher**: User experience research
- **ui-designer**: Interface design
- **product-analytics**: Metrics and insights
- **user-research**: User feedback and testing
- **product-strategy**: Long-term vision

## Critical Project Patterns

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
- Always prefix DynamoDB keys with `TENANT#{tenant_id}`
- Use IAM session tags for tenant context
- Validate tenant in Lambda authorizers
- Never mix tenant data

### Event Processing
- All events must include `tenant_id` and `submission_id`
- Implement idempotency with conditional writes
- Use DLQs for all critical targets
- Archive events for 30 days minimum

### Security Requirements
- HMAC authentication for ingestion
- Secrets in Secrets Manager only
- No hardcoded credentials
- Least privilege IAM roles

## Testing Standards
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Integration tests for all workflows
- Load testing before production
- Security scanning on all dependencies

## Documentation Requirements
- Every agent updates their strategy document
- API documentation in OpenAPI format
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Runbooks for operations

## Cost Optimization Targets
- Lambda: < $50/month for 1M submissions
- DynamoDB: On-demand billing initially
- EventBridge: ~$1 per million events
- Total: < $100/month for MVP

## Performance Benchmarks
- API response time: < 200ms p99
- Lambda cold start: < 1 second
- DynamoDB read/write: < 10ms
- End-to-end processing: < 5 seconds

## Active Development Focus
Currently building MVP with:
1. HMAC-authenticated ingestion API
2. EventBridge routing to Lambda processors
3. DynamoDB multi-tenant storage
4. Step Functions delivery orchestration
5. Basic admin UI for monitoring

- Architecture docs: `/docs/architecture/`
- API specs: `/docs/api/`
- Runbooks: `/docs/runbooks/`
