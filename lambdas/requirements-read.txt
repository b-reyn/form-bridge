# Minimal dependencies for read-submissions Lambda function
# boto3 is already available in Lambda runtime environment
# Only add dependencies if absolutely necessary for cost optimization

# No additional dependencies needed - using only built-in Python libraries:
# - json (built-in)
# - base64 (built-in) 
# - datetime (built-in)
# - os (built-in)
# - typing (built-in)
# - boto3 (Lambda runtime)
