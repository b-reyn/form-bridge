# MVP Requirements - Minimal for Fast Deployment
# Only essential packages, no complex dependencies

# AWS SDK (comes with Lambda runtime, but explicit version for consistency)
boto3>=1.34.0

# No additional dependencies needed for MVP
# Future iterations can add:
# - aws-lambda-powertools (for production monitoring)
# - cryptography (for HMAC validation)  
# - httpx (for webhook deliveries)
# - structlog (for structured logging)
