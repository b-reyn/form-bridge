# Ultra-Simple Form-Bridge Requirements
#
# This file is intentionally minimal/empty because:
# 1. boto3 is included in AWS Lambda Python runtime
# 2. All required modules are Python standard library:
#    - json (built-in)
#    - hmac (built-in)  
#    - hashlib (built-in)
#    - os (built-in)
#    - datetime (built-in)
#    - typing (built-in)
#
# This reduces:
# - Package size (faster cold starts)
# - Deployment time (no dependencies to install)
# - Cost (smaller deployment package)
#
# For production, consider adding:
# - aws-lambda-powertools[all]==2.* (for structured logging)
# - requests==2.* (if HTTP requests needed)
# - cryptography==* (for advanced encryption)

# No dependencies needed for ultra-simple implementation
