### Intelligent Compression Implementation
```python
# Compression Strategy
compression_config = {
    'threshold': '1KB',  # Compress payloads > 1KB
    'algorithm': 'zlib',  # ARM64 optimized
    'level': 6,  # Balance compression ratio vs CPU
    'savings_target': '70%'  # Storage cost reduction
}
```

### Envelope Encryption Cost Optimization
```yaml
Envelope Encryption Pattern:
  Master Key: Single CMK shared across tenants
  Data Keys: Tenant-specific, generated per encryption
  Cost Reduction: 70% vs individual CMKs per tenant
  Compliance: Maintains tenant data isolation
  
Implementation:
  - Shared master CMK: $1/month vs $100+/month
  - Tenant-specific data key generation
  - Proper key rotation and management
  - Audit trail and compliance reporting
```

## 💡 Advanced Optimization Strategies

### Usage-Based Pricing Model Framework
```python
# Cost Allocation Algorithm
def calculate_tenant_cost(tenant_usage):
    return {
        'base_cost': calculate_infrastructure_share(),
        'usage_cost': calculate_consumption_cost(tenant_usage),
        'optimization_savings': calculate_efficiency_bonus(),
        'total_allocated_cost': base + usage - savings
    }
```
