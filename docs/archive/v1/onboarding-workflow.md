# Form-Bridge Onboarding Workflow Design

## Executive Summary
A progressive, personalized onboarding flow that gets users from signup to their first successful form routing in under 10 minutes, with special optimization for agencies managing multiple WordPress sites.

## Core Principles
1. **Quick Win First**: Route one form successfully before asking for more setup
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal advanced features only when needed
3. **Self-Service**: Minimize manual intervention through automation
4. **Agency-Optimized**: Bulk operations and site grouping from day one

## Stage 1: Account Creation & First Login (2-3 minutes)

### 1.1 Registration Flow

**Entry Points:**
- Direct signup from landing page
- WordPress plugin "Get API Key" button
- Partner referral links

**Signup Form (Minimal Friction):**
```
Required Fields Only:
- Email address
- Password (with strength indicator)
- [Continue with Google/Microsoft] (OAuth options)

NOT Required Initially:
- Company name (ask later)
- Phone number (never required)
- Credit card (free tier first)
```

**Email Verification:**
- Send verification email but DON'T block access
- Allow immediate dashboard access
- Show gentle reminder banner: "Please verify your email to unlock all features"
- Auto-verify if user clicks link within 7 days

### 1.2 Initial Workspace Setup

**Welcome Screen:**
```
"Welcome to Form-Bridge! Let's get your first form routing in 3 minutes."

What describes you best?
[ ] I manage one WordPress site (Solo)
[ ] I manage 2-10 sites (Small Agency)  
[ ] I manage 10+ sites (Agency) [RECOMMENDED PATH]
[ ] I'm just exploring

[Continue ‚Üí]
```

**Personalization Based on Selection:**
- **Solo**: Skip to single site setup
- **Small Agency**: Show site grouping options
- **Agency**: Enable bulk operations immediately
- **Exploring**: Provide sandbox environment

### 1.3 Tier Selection (Deferred)

**Progressive Pricing:**
- Start on free tier automatically (100 submissions/month)
- Show upgrade prompts only after:
  - 50% of free tier consumed
  - Attempting to add 4th destination
  - Requesting premium features

**Tier Structure:**
```
Free: 100 submissions, 1 site, 3 destinations
Starter ($29): 10K submissions, 10 sites, unlimited destinations  
Pro ($99): 100K submissions, unlimited sites, priority support
Enterprise: Custom pricing, SLA, dedicated support
```

## Stage 2: First WordPress Site Connection (3-4 minutes)

### 2.1 Plugin Download Mechanism

**Smart Plugin Delivery:**
```
"Let's connect your first WordPress site"

Option A: [Quick Install] - One-click install via WordPress.com API
Option B: [Download Plugin] - Manual installation (.zip file)
Option C: [Install via WP Admin] - Copy install command

For Agencies:
[Bulk Setup] - Download master plugin with pre-configured API key
```

### 2.2 Installation Guidance

**Interactive Installation Guide:**
```
Step-by-step with screenshots:
1. ‚úì Plugin downloaded
2. ‚è≥ Upload to WordPress (Show: Plugins > Add New > Upload)
3. ‚è≥ Activate plugin
4. ‚è≥ Plugin will auto-register...

[Having trouble? Watch 60-second video]
[Chat with support]
```

### 2.3 Self-Registration Process

**Automatic Site Registration:**
```
Plugin Auto-Registration Flow:
1. Plugin activated on WordPress site
2. Generates site UUID and HMAC secret
3. Sends registration request to Form-Bridge API:
   {
     "site_url": "agency-site-001.com",
     "site_name": "Client ABC Site",
     "wordpress_version": "6.4",
     "plugin_version": "1.0.0",
     "admin_email": "admin@agency.com"
   }
4. API creates DynamoDB entry:
   PK: TENANT#agency_123
   SK: SITE#auto_generated_uuid
5. Returns confirmation to plugin
6. Plugin stores HMAC secret locally
```

### 2.4 Connection Verification

**Real-Time Verification:**
```
Dashboard shows live status:
[‚è≥] Waiting for plugin activation...
[‚úì] Site connected: agency-site-001.com
[!] Test form ready to submit

Quick Test:
"Click here to send a test form from your site"
[One-click test that submits form with dummy data]
```

---

## Stage 3: Bulk Site Management (Agencies)

### 3.1 Efficient Multi-Site Addition

**Bulk Operations Interface:**
```
"Add Multiple Sites"

Option 1: [Master Plugin]
Download one plugin with your API key embedded
Install on all sites (they auto-register)

Option 2: [CSV Import]
Upload CSV with site URLs and names
We'll generate individual setup links

Option 3: [WordPress Multisite]
Single plugin installation for entire network

Option 4: [API Integration]
POST /sites/bulk with array of sites
```

### 3.2 Site Grouping/Tagging

**Organization Structure:**
```
Sites Organization:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Client Groups
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ABC Corp (15 sites)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ XYZ Inc (8 sites)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Personal Sites (3 sites)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Site Types
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ E-commerce (12 sites)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Lead Generation (18 sites)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Contact Forms (10 sites)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Environments
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Production (35 sites)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Staging (5 sites)

[Bulk Actions]: Apply destinations to entire groups
```

### 3.3 Credential Management

**Shared vs Individual Credentials:**
```
Destination Credentials Strategy:

Shared (Recommended for Agencies):
- One HubSpot API key for all client sites
- Single Slack workspace for notifications
- Stored at agency level in DynamoDB

Individual (Per-Client):
- Separate Salesforce instances per client
- Different S3 buckets per site
- Override shared credentials when needed

DynamoDB Structure:
PK: CLIENT#agency_123, SK: CONNECTOR#hubspot (shared)
PK: CLIENT#agency_123, SK: SITE#001#CONNECTOR#salesforce (individual)
```

---

## Stage 4: First Destination Setup (2-3 minutes)

### 4.1 Destination Selection

**Smart Recommendation:**
```
"Where should we send your form submissions?"

Popular Quick Starts:
[Email] - Get instant notifications (30 seconds)
[Slack] - Team notifications (1 minute)
[Google Sheets] - Simple spreadsheet (2 minutes)

CRM Integration:
[HubSpot] [Salesforce] [Pipedrive]

4. Test connection: [Send test message]
```

**Secure Storage Pattern:**
```
DynamoDB Entry:

SK: CONNECTOR#slack#workspace_001
Attributes: {
  connector_type: "slack",
  webhook_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/...",
  channel: "#form-notifications",
