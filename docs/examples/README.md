# Form-Bridge Example Code

*Last Updated: January 26, 2025*  
*Status: REFERENCE ONLY - Not for production use*

## Overview

This directory contains example code and reference implementations that were created during the design and research phases of the Form-Bridge project. These are not production-ready components but serve as references for implementation patterns.

## Directory Structure

### `/security/`
Security monitoring and implementation examples:
- `security-monitoring-implementation.py` - CloudWatch security event processing, anomaly detection, threat correlation

### `/wordpress-auth/`
WordPress multi-site authentication design examples:
- `dynamodb-design.py` - DynamoDB single-table design for WordPress authentication
- `query-patterns.py` - Advanced query patterns and migration strategies
- `security-implementation.py` - Security features including encryption, monitoring, and compliance

## Important Notes

⚠️ **These are example implementations only**
- Created during the design phase for proof-of-concept
- May contain outdated patterns or approaches
- Should be referenced but not directly copied into production
- Production implementations should follow the patterns in `/lambdas/` directory

## Usage

These examples can be referenced when:
- Understanding the original design thinking
- Looking for implementation patterns
- Reviewing security considerations
- Understanding DynamoDB access patterns

For production-ready code, refer to:
- `/lambdas/` - Actual Lambda function implementations
- `/infrastructure/` - CloudFormation/SAM templates
- `/docs/mvp/BUILD_DEPLOY_VALIDATE_PLAN.md` - Current implementation plan
