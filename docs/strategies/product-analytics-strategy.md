# Product Analytics Strategy - Form-Bridge Platform

## Current Best Practices (Updated: 2025-08-26)

### 2025 B2B SaaS Analytics Trends
- **Real-time Observability**: Sub-second data freshness for critical metrics
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Time series + cohort + funnel analysis
- **Embedded Analytics**: Dashboard widgets directly in workflow context
- **Predictive Insights**: ML-powered anomaly detection and forecasting
- **Self-service Analytics**: Low-code/no-code report building
- **Privacy-first Metrics**: GDPR/CCPA compliant data handling

### Form Processing Platform Benchmarks
- **Uptime SLA**: 99.9% (8.76 hours downtime/year)
- **Processing Latency**: P95 < 2 seconds end-to-end
- **Dashboard Load Time**: < 1 second for key metrics
- **Data Freshness**: Critical metrics < 30 seconds, reports < 5 minutes
- **Error Rate Threshold**: < 0.1% for successful form submissions

## Project-Specific Patterns

### FormBridge Metrics Hierarchy
```
North Star Metric: Successful Form Submissions per Day
├── Leading Indicators
│   ├── Form Submission Volume
│   ├── Processing Success Rate
│   └── Destination Delivery Rate
├── Health Metrics
│   ├── API Response Time
│   ├── Error Rates by Component
│   └── System Availability
└── Business Metrics
    ├── Active Sites per Tenant
    ├── Submission Volume Growth
    └── Feature Adoption Rates
```

### DynamoDB Single-Table Access Patterns
- **Real-time Metrics**: GSI on timestamp for time-series queries
- **Tenant Isolation**: PK prefix ensures data separation
- **Aggregation Strategy**: Pre-computed hourly/daily rollups
- **Query Optimization**: Composite keys for multi-dimensional filtering

### EventBridge Analytics Integration
- **Metric Events**: Emit structured events for all key actions
- **Dead Letter Monitoring**: Track failed deliveries per destination
- **Processing Pipeline**: Async metric aggregation via Lambda
- **Custom Dimensions**: Tenant, site, form_type, destination_type

## Decision Log

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Real-time vs Batch Processing** (2025-08-26)
   - Decision: Hybrid approach - critical metrics real-time, detailed reports batch
   - Rationale: Balance between cost and user experience
   - Implementation: EventBridge -> Kinesis Data Streams -> Lambda aggregators

2. **Data Retention Strategy** (2025-08-26)
   - Decision: 90 days detailed, 2 years aggregated, 7 years compliance
   - Rationale: Operational needs vs storage costs
   - Implementation: DynamoDB TTL + S3 archival

3. **Dashboard Technology Stack** (2025-08-26)
   - Decision: React + Recharts + WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Rationale: Cost-effective, performant, maintainable
   - Alternative considered: Third-party analytics platform (too expensive)

## Knowledge Base

### Performance Optimizations Learned
- **Query Patterns**: Always include tenant_id in partition key
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for dashboard aggregations (1-minute TTL)
- **Data Modeling**: Separate hot (current day) vs cold (historical) tables
- **API Design**: Paginated responses with cursor-based pagination

### Cost Optimization Discoveries
- **DynamoDB**: On-demand billing for variable workloads
- **Lambda**: Provisioned concurrency only for critical real-time functions
- **CloudWatch**: Custom metrics cost $0.30/metric/month - use sparingly
- **EventBridge**: Batch events where possible to reduce costs

### Security Considerations
- **Multi-tenant Data**: Never expose cross-tenant metrics
- **API Access**: Role-based permissions for different metric levels
- **Data Privacy**: Hash PII in analytics events
- **Audit Trail**: Log all dashboard access for compliance

## Implementation Framework

### Metric Collection Architecture
```python
METRIC_COLLECTION = {
    "ingestion": {
        "source": "API Gateway Access Logs + Lambda",
        "frequency": "Real-time",
        "storage": "DynamoDB + Kinesis"
    },
    "processing": {
        "source": "EventBridge Events",
        "frequency": "Real-time + Batch",
        "storage": "DynamoDB GSI"
    },
    "delivery": {
        "source": "Step Functions + Lambda",
        "frequency": "Async tracking",
        "storage": "DynamoDB + S3"
    }
}
```

### Dashboard Performance Targets
- **Initial Load**: < 1 second
- **Widget Refresh**: < 500ms
- **Large Reports**: < 5 seconds
- **Real-time Updates**: < 30 seconds latency
- **Concurrent Users**: 100+ per tenant

## Validated Metrics Framework

### Primary KPIs Defined (2025-08-26)
```json
{
  "north_star": "Daily Successful Submissions",
  "leading_indicators": [
    "Processing Success Rate (>98%)",
    "End-to-End Delivery Rate (>95%)", 
    "Average Processing Time (<2s P95)"
  ],
  "business_metrics": [
    "Active Sites per Tenant",
    "Cost per Submission (<$0.0005)",
    "Destination Health Score"
  ],
  "operational_metrics": [
    "System Uptime (99.9%)",
    "Error Rate by Component (<0.1%)",
    "Alert Response Time (<5min)"
  ]
}
```

### Dashboard Widget Architecture
- **Real-time Widgets**: 8 core widgets with <100ms refresh
- **Time-series Charts**: Optimized for 1000+ data points
- **Filtering System**: 5-dimensional filtering (time, site, destination, form, status)
- **Export Capabilities**: 5 formats (PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON, PNG/SVG)
- **Alert System**: 4-tier severity with intelligent grouping

### DynamoDB Access Patterns Optimized
- **Tenant Overview**: Single query <50ms
- **Site Drill-down**: GSI query <100ms 
- **Time Series**: Range query <200ms for 7-day data
- **Real-time Events**: Event-driven updates <30s latency
