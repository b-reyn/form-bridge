# UX Researcher Strategy - Form-Bridge Dashboard

## Current Best Practices (Updated August 2025)

### Dashboard Design Principles
- **User-Centric Clarity**: Focus on critical KPIs users need in 5 seconds
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Limit to 5-6 cards in initial view, single screen preferred
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features hidden behind clear interactions
- **Real-Time Updates**: Smooth transitions with "last refreshed" timestamps
- **Consistency**: Same patterns across all dashboard sections
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, color-blind friendly, screen reader support

### Multi-Tenant UX Patterns
- **Tenant Context**: Clear visual indication of current tenant/site
- **Bulk Operations**: Essential for agency users managing 50+ sites
- **Role-Based Views**: Different interfaces for different user types
- **Localization**: Support for global users and RTL languages

### Form Processing Specific Insights
- **Multi-Step Forms**: Break complex configurations into manageable steps
- **Progress Indicators**: Show completion status for multi-step processes
- **Error Recovery**: Clear paths to resolve failed submissions
- **Connection Health**: Visual status indicators for all integrations
