# DynamoDB Features Removed for MVP Deployment

## Overview
This document lists all DynamoDB features that were removed from the production-ready design to create a bare-bones configuration that deploys reliably. These features should be added back in Day 2 operations once the MVP is stable.

## Deployment Priority: Working > Perfect

**Philosophy:** Deploy first, enhance later. A working simple system is better than a broken complex system.

## Removed Security Features

### 1. Encryption at Rest (SSESpecification)
**Removed:**
```yaml
SSESpecification:
  SSEEnabled: true
  KMSMasterKeyId: !Ref DynamoDBKMSKey  
```

**Why Removed:** KMS key management adds complexity and potential circular dependencies in CloudFormation.

**Impact:** Data stored in plaintext (still encrypted by AWS default encryption)

**Day 2 Implementation:**
1. Create dedicated KMS key for DynamoDB
2. Update table to use customer-managed encryption
3. Implement key rotation policies
4. Add IAM policies for key access

### 2. Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
**Removed:**
```yaml
PointInTimeRecoverySpecification:
  PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled: true
```

**Why Removed:** Can cause deployment delays and requires additional IAM permissions.

**Impact:** No automatic backups, manual recovery only.

**Day 2 Implementation:**
1. Enable PITR on the table
2. Set up backup monitoring
3. Create restore procedures
4. Test recovery processes

## Removed Performance Features

### 3. DynamoDB Streams
**Removed:**
```yaml
StreamSpecification:
  StreamViewType: NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES
```

**Why Removed:** Streams require additional Lambda functions and IAM roles, adding complexity.

**Impact:** No real-time change detection, no automatic EventBridge integration.

**Day 2 Implementation:**
1. Enable streams with NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES
2. Create stream processing Lambda
3. Integrate with EventBridge for real-time updates
4. Implement stream-based metrics

### 4. Time-to-Live (TTL)
**Removed:**
```yaml
TimeToLiveSpecification:
  AttributeName: ttl
  Enabled: true
```

**Why Removed:** TTL can cause confusion during testing and debugging.

**Impact:** No automatic data cleanup, manual housekeeping required.

**Day 2 Implementation:**
1. Add TTL attribute to schema
2. Enable TTL with appropriate expiration times
3. Set up monitoring for TTL deletions
4. Implement TTL-based data lifecycle policies

### 5. Additional Global Secondary Indexes
**Removed:**
```yaml
# Additional GSIs for different query patterns
- IndexName: StatusIndex
  KeySchema:
    - AttributeName: GSI2PK
      KeyType: HASH
    - AttributeName: GSI2SK
      KeyType: RANGE
  Projection:
    ProjectionType: INCLUDE
    NonKeyAttributes: [status, form_id, tenant_id]
```

**Why Removed:** Multiple GSIs increase deployment complexity and can fail independently.

**Impact:** Limited query flexibility, some queries may require scans.

**Day 2 Implementation:**
1. Add GSI2 for status-based queries
2. Add GSI3 for time-based analytics
3. Optimize projections based on actual usage
4. Monitor GSI performance and costs

## Removed Operational Features

### 6. Advanced Monitoring and Alarms
**Removed:**
- CloudWatch alarms for throttling
- Custom metrics for business logic
- Cost monitoring alerts
- Performance monitoring dashboards

**Why Removed:** Monitoring resources can have dependencies that prevent initial deployment.

**Impact:** No automated alerting, manual monitoring required.

**Day 2 Implementation:**
1. Create CloudWatch alarms for key metrics
2. Set up cost monitoring and alerts
3. Implement business metrics dashboards
4. Add automated anomaly detection

### 7. Backup Policies
**Removed:**
```yaml
BackupPolicy:
  PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled: true
ContinuousBackups:
  PointInTimeRecoverySpecification:
    PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled: true
```

**Why Removed:** Backup policies can cause deployment timing issues.

**Impact:** No automated backup schedule beyond PITR.

**Day 2 Implementation:**
1. Set up on-demand backup schedules
2. Implement cross-region backup replication
3. Create backup retention policies
4. Test restore procedures regularly

### 8. Resource Tags and Organization
**Removed:**
- Comprehensive tagging strategy
- Resource naming conventions
- Cost allocation tags
- Environment-specific configurations

**Why Removed:** Complex tagging can cause deployment validation errors.

**Impact:** Harder to organize resources and track costs.

**Day 2 Implementation:**
1. Implement comprehensive tagging strategy
2. Add cost allocation tags
3. Create resource naming conventions
4. Set up tag-based access policies

## Removed Advanced Patterns

### 9. Write Sharding Strategy
**Removed:** The entire write sharding implementation for high-volume tenants.

**Why Removed:** Sharding logic adds complexity and requires additional Lambda functions.

**Impact:** Potential hot partitions for high-volume tenants (>1000 writes/second).

**Day 2 Implementation:**
1. Implement tenant volume monitoring
2. Add write sharding for high-volume tenants
3. Create shard management utilities
4. Monitor partition distribution

### 10. Payload Compression
**Removed:** Intelligent compression for large form payloads.

**Why Removed:** Compression requires Lambda layers and additional processing logic.

**Impact:** Higher storage costs for large payloads, potential item size limits.

**Day 2 Implementation:**
1. Implement gzip compression for >1KB payloads
2. Add S3 offloading for very large payloads
3. Create compression performance monitoring
4. Optimize compression algorithms

### 11. Pre-Aggregated Metrics
**Removed:** Pre-computed dashboard metrics and analytics tables.

**Why Removed:** Metrics aggregation requires additional tables and processing logic.

**Impact:** Dashboard queries may be slower, higher query costs.

**Day 2 Implementation:**
1. Create metrics aggregation tables
2. Implement real-time metrics updates
3. Add batch metrics processing
4. Create analytics dashboards

### 12. Advanced Security Patterns
**Removed:**
- VPC endpoints for DynamoDB access
- Fine-grained access policies
- Audit logging for data access
- Data masking for sensitive fields

**Why Removed:** Advanced security features add significant complexity.

**Impact:** Basic security only, no advanced compliance features.

**Day 2 Implementation:**
1. Set up VPC endpoints
2. Implement fine-grained IAM policies
3. Add audit logging and monitoring
4. Create data classification and masking

## Conclusion
