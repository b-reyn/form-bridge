# Form-Bridge MVP: Phase-Based Implementation Plan

*Version: 1.0 | Date: January 2025*  
*Approach: Feature-Complete Phases for Claude Code Development*

## Overview
This plan organizes Form-Bridge MVP development into self-contained phases optimized for Claude Code. Each phase delivers complete, testable functionality and can serve as a clean context boundary for conversation management.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Structure Philosophy

### Why Phase-Based vs Sprint-Based?
- **Context Management**: Clear break points for conversation reset
- **Feature Completeness**: Each phase delivers working functionality
- **Self-Contained**: Phases can start fresh with handoff documentation
- **Test-Driven**: Every phase includes comprehensive testing
- **Documentation-First**: Context preserved through documentation

### Phase Transition Pattern
```
Phase N Complete â†’ Document State â†’ Context Reset â†’ Phase N+1 Begins
```

2. **Verify entry criteria** are met
3. **Set up testing environment** for the phase
4. **Create phase-specific branch** if needed

### During Each Phase
1. **Follow TDD methodology** - write tests first
2. **Document as you build** - maintain context
3. **Run integration tests** with previous phases
4. **Monitor costs** against targets

### Before Completing Each Phase
1. **Run full test suite** and verify coverage
2. **Test integration** with existing phases
3. **Update documentation** for handoff
4. **Prepare context summary** for next phase

### Phase Completion Checklist
- [ ] All exit criteria met
- [ ] Tests passing with required coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Integration validated
- [ ] Handoff document created
- [ ] Context ready for reset

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of Phase-Based Approach

### For Claude Code Development
- **Focused Context**: Each conversation stays on one feature area
- **Clear Boundaries**: Know exactly when a phase is "done"
- **Testable Progress**: Each phase delivers working functionality
- **Easy Debugging**: Issues isolated to specific phases
- **Documentation-Driven**: Context preserved between phases

### For Project Management
- **Measurable Progress**: Clear completion criteria
- **Flexible Timeline**: Phases can take as long as needed
- **Quality Gates**: No moving to next phase until current is solid
- **Risk Mitigation**: Problems contained to individual phases
- **Context Management**: Clean slate for each major feature

### For Maintenance
- **Modular Design**: Each phase creates self-contained modules
- **Clear Ownership**: Know which phase introduced which functionality
- **Debugging**: Trace issues to specific phases
- **Enhancement**: Add features by extending existing phases
- **Documentation**: Phase-based docs mirror code structure

This phase-based approach allows Claude Code to work systematically through Form-Bridge development with clear context boundaries, complete feature delivery, and comprehensive testing at each step.
