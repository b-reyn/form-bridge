# Form-Bridge Repository Migration Plan

*Created: August 26, 2025*
*Purpose: Guide the transition from legacy structure to architecture-first organization*

## Migration Overview

This migration transforms Form-Bridge from a complex-first repository to an **architecture-first** organization that promotes the ultra-simple $0/month approach while preserving all existing enterprise work.

## Phase 1: Architecture Directory Creation (Week 1)

### Ultra-Simple Architecture
```bash
# Already exists, needs to be moved
mv ultra-simple/ architectures/ultra-simple/
```

**Files to move:**
- `/ultra-simple/README.md` → `/architectures/ultra-simple/README.md`
- `/ultra-simple/handler.py` → `/architectures/ultra-simple/handler.py`
- `/ultra-simple/template.yaml` → `/architectures/ultra-simple/template.yaml`
- `/ultra-simple/deploy.sh` → `/architectures/ultra-simple/deploy.sh`
- `/ultra-simple/test_client.py` → `/architectures/ultra-simple/test_client.py`

### Enterprise Architecture Directory Setup
```bash
mkdir -p architectures/enterprise/{infrastructure,services,shared,statemachines,dashboard}
```

## Phase 2: Enterprise Architecture Migration (Week 2)

### Infrastructure Files
**Source → Destination:**
- `template-mvp-*.yaml` → `architectures/enterprise/infrastructure/`
- `template-arm64-optimized.yaml` → `architectures/enterprise/infrastructure/`
- `infrastructure/cost-optimization-stack.ts` → `architectures/enterprise/infrastructure/`
- `infrastructure/deployment-bucket.yaml` → `architectures/enterprise/infrastructure/`
- `infrastructure/oidc-provider.yaml` → `architectures/enterprise/infrastructure/`

### Lambda Functions (Services)
**Current lambdas/ → architectures/enterprise/services/:**

#### Ingestion Services
- `lambdas/mvp-ingest-handler.py` → `architectures/enterprise/services/ingestion/api-handler.py`
- `lambdas/mvp-api-authorizer.py` → `architectures/enterprise/services/ingestion/authorizer.py`
- `lambdas/optimized-hmac-authorizer.py` → `architectures/enterprise/services/ingestion/hmac-authorizer.py`

#### Processing Services

#### Administrative Services
- `lambdas/eventbridge-dlq-manager.py` → `architectures/enterprise/services/admin/dlq-manager.py`
- `lambdas/eventbridge-replay-manager.py` → `architectures/enterprise/services/admin/event-replay.py`
- `lambdas/automated-incident-response.py` → `architectures/enterprise/services/admin/incident-response.py`

### State Machines
- `statemachines/delivery-workflow.asl.json` → `architectures/enterprise/statemachines/`

### Shared Libraries
- `lambdas/layers/` → `architectures/enterprise/shared/layers/`
- `lambdas/wp-plugin-auth/` → `plugins/wordpress/server-side/` (split between architectures)

## Phase 3: Plugin and Tool Organization (Week 3)

### WordPress Plugin Consolidation
**Current scattered files → plugins/wordpress/:**
- `lambdas/wp-plugin-auth/` content → `plugins/wordpress/server-side/`
- Create `plugins/wordpress/examples/` with architecture-specific configs

### Development Tools Migration
**scripts/ → tools/deployment/:**
- `scripts/mvp-deploy.sh` → `tools/deployment/enterprise-deploy.sh`
- `scripts/quick-deploy.sh` → `tools/deployment/quick-deploy.sh`
- `scripts/validate-deployment.sh` → `tools/deployment/validate-deployment.sh`

**Testing Tools:**
- `scripts/arm64-performance-test.py` → `tools/testing/performance-test.py`
- `scripts/test-mvp.py` → `tools/testing/integration-test.py`
- `scripts/setup-test-infrastructure.py` → `tools/testing/setup-infrastructure.py`

### Monitoring Tools
- Create `tools/monitoring/cost-calculator.py` (extract from test_client.py)
- `cloudwatch-metric-math-expressions.json` → `tools/monitoring/`

## Phase 4: Documentation Restructure (Week 4)

### Getting Started Guides Creation
Create `docs/getting-started/` with:
- `README.md` - Architecture comparison hub
- `ultra-simple-guide.md` - Extract from `/architectures/ultra-simple/README.md`
- `enterprise-guide.md` - Compilation from existing MVP docs
- `migration-guide.md` - When and how to scale from ultra-simple

### Architecture Documentation Updates
- Move `/ULTRA_SIMPLE_ARCHITECTURE.md` → `docs/architecture/ultra-simple-analysis.md`
- Update `docs/architecture/README.md` to compare both architectures
- Create `docs/architecture/cost-analysis.md` with real cost comparisons
- Create `docs/architecture/scaling-paths.md` with migration triggers

### Legacy Documentation
**Large docs to reorganize:**
- `MVP-QUICK-DEPLOY.md` → Split between architecture READMEs
- `FAST-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` → `docs/getting-started/enterprise-guide.md`
- `CI_CD_SETUP_GUIDE.md` → `docs/guides/ci-cd-setup.md`
- `BARE_BONES_DYNAMODB_SUMMARY.md` → `architectures/enterprise/services/storage/README.md`

## Phase 5: Legacy Directory Creation (Transition Support)

### Create Legacy Mapping
```bash
mkdir legacy/
```

Create `/legacy/README.md` with complete file mapping:

```markdown
# Legacy File Mappings

This directory provides mappings for files that have been moved in the August 2025 reorganization.

## Lambda Functions
- `lambdas/mvp-ingest-handler.py` → `architectures/enterprise/services/ingestion/api-handler.py`
- `lambdas/mvp-event-processor.py` → `architectures/enterprise/services/processing/event-processor.py`
[... complete mapping ...]

## Scripts
- `scripts/mvp-deploy.sh` → `tools/deployment/enterprise-deploy.sh`
[... complete mapping ...]

## Templates
- `template-mvp-*.yaml` → `architectures/enterprise/infrastructure/`
[... complete mapping ...]
```

### Symlink Strategy (30-day transition)
```bash
# Create temporary symlinks for CI/CD compatibility
ln -s ../architectures/enterprise/services/ lambdas
ln -s ../tools/deployment/ scripts  
ln -s ../architectures/enterprise/infrastructure/template-mvp-fast-deploy.yaml .
```

## Migration Commands

### Automated Migration Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: tools/migrate-repository.sh

set -e

echo "Starting Form-Bridge repository migration..."

# Phase 1: Create architecture directories
mkdir -p architectures/{ultra-simple,enterprise}/{infrastructure,services,shared,statemachines,dashboard}

# Phase 2: Move ultra-simple (already exists)
if [ -d "ultra-simple" ]; then
    mv ultra-simple/ architectures/ultra-simple/
    echo "✓ Moved ultra-simple architecture"
fi

# Phase 3: Move enterprise infrastructure
mv template-*.yaml architectures/enterprise/infrastructure/ 2>/dev/null || true
mv infrastructure/* architectures/enterprise/infrastructure/ 2>/dev/null || true

# Phase 4: Move enterprise services
mkdir -p architectures/enterprise/services/{ingestion,processing,storage,delivery,monitoring,admin}

# Move lambda functions to appropriate services
mv lambdas/mvp-ingest* architectures/enterprise/services/ingestion/ 2>/dev/null || true
mv lambdas/*event-processor* architectures/enterprise/services/processing/ 2>/dev/null || true
mv lambdas/*form-processor* architectures/enterprise/services/storage/ 2>/dev/null || true
# ... (continue for all lambda functions)

# Phase 5: Move tools
mkdir -p tools/{deployment,testing,monitoring}
mv scripts/* tools/deployment/ 2>/dev/null || true

# Phase 6: Create legacy mapping
mkdir -p legacy/
cat > legacy/README.md << 'EOF'
# Legacy File Mappings
This directory provides mappings for the August 2025 reorganization.
See MIGRATION_PLAN.md for complete details.

## Validation Checklist

### Architecture Completeness
- [ ] Ultra-simple architecture is self-contained in `/architectures/ultra-simple/`
- [ ] Enterprise architecture is complete in `/architectures/enterprise/`
- [ ] Both architectures have comprehensive README files
- [ ] Cost implications are clearly documented

### Plugin Compatibility
- [ ] WordPress plugin works with ultra-simple architecture
- [ ] WordPress plugin works with enterprise architecture
- [ ] Configuration examples exist for both architectures
- [ ] Integration tests pass for both deployment targets

### Tool Functionality
- [ ] Deployment scripts work from new locations
- [ ] Testing utilities support both architectures
- [ ] Monitoring tools provide architecture-specific insights
- [ ] Cost calculator accurately reflects both approaches

### Documentation Quality
- [ ] Getting started guides exist for both architectures
- [ ] Migration path from ultra-simple to enterprise is documented
- [ ] All major directories have README files
- [ ] Legacy file mappings are complete and accurate

### Backward Compatibility
- [ ] Existing CI/CD pipelines can be updated incrementally
- [ ] External integrations (WordPress) continue working
- [ ] Deployment scripts maintain same functionality
- [ ] No breaking changes to public APIs

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **CI/CD Pipeline Updates**: Gradual migration over 2 weeks
2. **WordPress Plugin Compatibility**: Test with both architectures
3. **Deployment Script Changes**: Maintain existing functionality
4. **Documentation Link Updates**: Comprehensive link audit

### Rollback Plan
If migration issues arise:
1. **Immediate**: Use symlinks to restore old paths
2. **Short-term**: Revert specific file moves while preserving new structure
3. **Long-term**: Complete rollback to pre-migration state (preserved in git)

### Testing Strategy
1. **Pre-migration**: Full test suite passes with current structure
2. **Post-migration**: Both architectures deploy and function correctly
3. **Integration**: WordPress plugin works with both architectures
4. **Performance**: No degradation in deployment or runtime performance

## Success Metrics

This migration succeeds when:
1. **New developers** find ultra-simple architecture first (>80%)
2. **Deployment time** for ultra-simple architecture is <5 minutes
3. **Cost clarity** - developers understand $0 vs $25-55/month implications
4. **Migration path** - >80% can successfully scale when needed
5. **No regressions** - existing functionality preserved 100%

---

*This migration plan should be executed in phases with thorough testing at each stage. The repository will be significantly more developer-friendly while preserving all existing functionality.*
